# Grain_Box
## Granular synthesiser controlled by a genetic algorithm

The user passes in a sound file. The grain box will analyse the file and pass out sounds made with granular synthesis, which the user will grade. The algorithm will learn that based on those frequencies, a certain outcome is more desirable than another.
